-Really know psych terms and/or try to contextualize unknown terms on the spot if needed for psych (parse out individual words/parts of the word, etc.). Even if you go through the entire section with 40-50 minutes to spare, suck it up and go through the psych section again and reason out any unknown terms or catch any stupid mistakes. I know my first instinct was to just exit because I was just so tired by the end of the day, but this really improved my psych score from the previous test.

-DON'T GET TILTED!! I got really disappointed in myself after Chem/Phys (I finished the section, but tried to go back near the end to finish calculations and ran out of time midway) and that feeling wrecked my ability to do CARS. During breaks, try to calm yourself down if you feel you under-performed in a section.
--That said, try to find ways to cut time without ruining your score, given my Chem section experience. This would give you more time to review any or all questions throughout the section."

Would not recommend, I studied 8 hrs per day. I'd recommend studying ~3 months before. Use the Khan questions, official practice exams, and any notes and textbooks from relevant courses. I didn't use Kaplan content, but from what I've seen from others, it didn't appear to be worth the price (save your money for applications, you'll definitely need it... :)).

For the first MCAT I took, I used the Barron's test prep book only. It's a decent book for review. I didn't have a lot of money at the time and I don't think the Khan questions were made at that point. For the second MCAT I took, I mostly used Khan academy practice questions (went through them all, and timed myself) and took two official practice tests. I also made notecards for concepts in C/P and B/B that I was weak on (amino acid structures, detailed steps of cellular respiration, etc.). I felt like the official practice exams were easier than the Khan questions, with the actual MCAT being somewhere in between. I expected my real score to be a few points lower than the official practice exams, since I knew they were easier with reference to the MCAT I took in the past. 

Tips for exam day: 
- write down important equations during the tutorial. It saves time, and you'll need them for C/P.  Make a notecard of equations ahead of time and memorize them. Dump equations on scratch paper when tutorial starts.
- Bring a mix of healthy snacks and favorite junk foods. Do take the allotted breaks, drink plenty of water (and caffeine)
- A few weeks before the exam, see how well you react to melatonin supplements before bedtime (you do NOT want to test this exam day! Some people oversleep or have other side effects). Before the first MCAT I took, I literally didn't sleep the night before. The second, I took melatonin and had a full, restful night of sleep. It made a huge difference!
- Highlight anything that may be of importance as you're reading any passage. Especially in CARS. It helps you keep track and stay focused."

I think TPR did a good job with content, although there was a point during my studying when I realized there was just no way I needed to know everything they threw at me. I didn't finish all the material along with the course due to time constraints, but after a certain point it just makes more sense to leave it and move onto AAMC materials.

PS is super strange-term heavy at times, but in general its a good primary exposure to the section and definitely helped guide my studying (focusing on terms I saw over and over again, learning sociology).

After 2 tests, I was unwilling to take another one due to the horrendous CARS section that is IMO completely unrepresentative: long passages with questions whose answers are completely out of nowhere and for some reason most passages are medically related, which isn't realistic. At the time, PS also felt unrepresentative: it was easy, with very few terms and short passages. In hindsight, its more representative than envisioned cuz it focuses on concepts and experimental results, something that the MCAT is turning towards. Note: no score, so I used a random reddit converter. Also: the test was very expensive. I only really took it to make sure I was exposing myself to multiple third parties before jumping into AAMC.

"I learned a lot from the other advice on this subreddit, so IÕll skip over the things everyone else says. Some specific key things that helped me: This spreadsheet that someone posted on this subreddit a while ago was incredible: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CkCWQhaN_XP-_1NGHqSLLDzZ1aivUaC7zLHa0-8W0d8/edit#gid=699658213  . Also, I would always highlight my CARS passages during exams, and I'd usually be really pressed on time with like 5 minutes left for the last passage, which caused me to sometimes get the last couple questions wrong. The day of my MCAT, I made a bold decision not to use the highlighter, and I did better on CARS than I did in any of my practice FLs. N=1 is crap data, but other people have said this too so I think *not* highlighting could be a good strategy for people to try out. The only thing I *don't* like about this subreddit is that people WAY overemphasize the need to study low yield content, saying things like ""nothing is low yield anymore"". Okay, except for P/SÉ I hate P/S because itÕs literally just straight memorization (but you will learn a lot of it just from doing the practice exams and section banks). But for C/P and B/B, I think the Ònothing is low yieldÓ motto is actually really bad advice. So much of the MCAT is reasoning based, where it's far better to have a strong conceptual understanding of main concepts than it is to memorize every detail of every enzyme and pathway. OK, there were like 2-3 straight memorization questions on my MCAT. But guess what, you can sometimes get a couple questions wrong on a section and still pull off a 132. Obviously take all my advice with a grain of salt (survivorship bias), but in my opinion, don't waste your time studying obscure details that wouldn't show up in an intro-level bio, chem, biochem, physics, or psyc/soc class. If you practice reading and understanding the research passages that go along with most of the c/p and b/b questions (and you can practice this just by doing practice exams and section banks), there were so many questions where all you needed was a basic understanding of the concept in order to reason out the answer from the information that they give you in the science passage. I also want to shoutout the Ortho528 anki deck and Khan Academy. I only got through like 1/3 of OrthoÕs deck, but there were actually some things from that deck on my exam. But if you do use OrthoÕs deck, and also for studying in general, DONÕT MEMORIZE RANDOM NUMBERS. DONÕT WASTE YOUR TIME MEMORIZING OBSCURE NUMBERS!!! OrthoÕs deck is TOO in depth, and a lot of that shit is way way too low yield to show up on the exam, so just kinda be aware of that if you decide to go the anki route. I also was only able to get through like 1/3 of the Khan Academy videos because they take so long, but they were such good resources. Honestly, you can straight up learn everything from Khan Academy and the AAMC resources. Lastly, I want to say that I obviously got very lucky to do so well. But if you study hard and study smart, you can certainly ace this exam. No matter how you did on your practice FLs, your premed classes, everything that happened in your life before this pointÉ there is nothing stopping you from stepping into that exam room and clicking on all the right answers. You can most likely still get a 132 with several questions wrong, and you might also guess some questions correctly. You got this."
